# IoT-Data-Simulation

### This project generates synthetic IoT sensor data to simulate real-time logistics tracking for smart supply chain systems. Each record includes geolocation, environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), vehicle speed, and package status over the last 24 hours. It's ideal for testing dashboards, analytics pipelines, or machine learning models in logistics and cold chain monitoring.

### Features
- Simulates data for multiple devices and packages
- Includes realistic values for speed, temperature, humidity, and location
- Outputs data in both CSV and JSON formats
- Useful for prototyping IoT platforms and logistics analytics
